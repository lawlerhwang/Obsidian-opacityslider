# Obsidian-opacityslider
A plugin to control Obsidian interface opacity with a simple slider

## Core Features
Opacity Slider: Adds a slider to the Obsidian interface, allowing you to change the window's transparency

## Use Cases
This plugin provides you with more flexible ways to use Obsidian:

1. "Discreet Mode"
Lower the transparency to make your Obsidian window less conspicuous.
In an office or public setting, it's harder for others to clearly see what you're working on, protecting your privacy.

3. Transparent Built-in Browser Experience:
For those using plugins that provide a built-in browser within Obsidian, you can make the window transparent to create a "floating" web browser, making it easier to browse the web.
